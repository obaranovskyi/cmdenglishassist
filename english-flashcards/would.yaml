  question: 'Provide an example: Polite request'
  answer:
    "
    When we want to ask for something politely, we say I would<br>
    like...<br>
    <br>
    - I would like a cup of tea, please.<br>
    - I would like the scones with jam.<br>
    - I would like a new notebook.<br>
    <br>
    We can use would like to request things for other people too.<br>
    <br>
    - I would like a sandwich and my husband would like the<br>
    salad.<br>
    - They would like water, please.<br>
    <br>
    The structure of this is subject + would like + object or subject +<br>
    would like + to-infinitive.<br>
    <br>
    We can also use would to make requests as a question.<br>
    <br>
    - Would you close the curtains, please?<br>
    - Would you buy me a newspaper?<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - invitations of offers'
  answer:
    "
    If we want to offer someone something or invite them somewhere, we also often use the word would. For example, if you want to politely offer someone a drink or some food, you can say:<br>
    <br>
    - Would you like a cup of tea?<br>
    - Would you like a biscuit with that?<br>
    <br>
    If you want to invite someone to an event or a place, you can say:<br>
    <br>
    - Would you like to come to our house tomorrow for dinner?<br>
    - Would you like to go to the party tonight?<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - reported speech'
  answer:
    "
    Reported speech is often a bit of a dreaded topic for English learners but it's actually quite easy when you know all the tenses.<br>
    And, it's especially easy when you use the word would. Whenever you see the word will in direct speech, you can use would in reported speech. Here are two examples:<br>
    <br>
    - She said she would come.<br>
    - They told me they would finish it by the next day.<br>
    <br>
    Let’s look at the transformation from direct speech to reported<br>
    speech:<br>
    <br>
    - “I will help you move house,” said Robert.<br>
    - Robert said he would help me move house.<br>
    <br>
    And another one:<br>
    <br>
    - 'I will be there at 5 pm,' said Jean.<br>
    - You told me you would be here at 5 pm!<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - typical behavior in the past'
  answer:
    "
    We also use would to talk about repeated actions in the past. These are actions we did often but don’t do anymore. Look at these examples:<br>
    <br>
    - When I was a child, we would go to France during the summer holidays.<br>
    - When Julian was at university, he would eat ready meals almost every night.<br>
    <br>
    You can’t use would to talk about states (love, like, etc.) in the past. For states, we use the structure used to or the past simple.<br>
    <br>
    - When I was a child, I used to love chocolate but now I don’t<br>
    like it.<br>
    <br>
    Take a look at some more examples of when you can use would to talk about repeated past actions:<br>
    <br>
    - Kaitlyn would drink milk with honey in the winter when she lived with her grandma.<br>
    - My friends and I would play football every evening when I was a teenager.<br>
    - My dad would often go away on business trips before he retired.<br>

    <h3>Past Simple</h3>
    We can always use the past simple as an alternative to ‘used to’ or ‘would’ to talk about past states or habits.
    The main difference is that the past simple doesn’t emphasise the repeated or continuous nature or the action or situation.
    Also, the past simple doesn’t make it so clear that the thing is no longer true.<br>
    <br>
    - We went to the same beach every summer.<br>
    - We used to go to the same beach every summer.<br>
    - We would go to the same beach every summer.<br>
    <br>
    If something happened only once, we must use past simple.<br>
    <br>
    - I went to Egypt 2014.<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - willingness in the past'
  answer:
    "
    If you want to talk about how willing or happy someone was to do something in the past, you can use the word ‘would.’
    Although we usually use this in a negative sense, so use the word ‘wouldn’t.’<br>
    <br>
    - The shop wouldn’t give me a refund even though my new phone is obviously broken!<br>
    - Dave wouldn’t carry any of my boxes for me.<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - hypothetical situations'
  answer:
    "
    You can use would to talk about unreal or hypothetical situations. These are situations that we are imagining.<br>
    <br>
    - I would like to live in Spain because the weather’s beautiful.<br>
    (but I live in England!)<br>
    - That restaurant would be too expensive. (so we won’t go there!)<br>
    - I would get seasick with those huge waves so we’re not going on the boat trip.<br>
    - They would love to visit Australia one day.<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - conditional sentences'
  answer:
    "
    The second conditional<br>
    <br>
    We use would in the second conditional to talk about imaginary, impossible or very unlikely situations in the present. With the second conditional, however, we have two clauses: the if clause and the would clause.<br>
    <br>
    - If I moved to another country, I would miss my parents.<br>
    - Claire would take a trip around the world if she won the<br>
    lottery.<br>
    - If they spoke English, they would move to New Zealand.<br>
    - They would help you if you asked them politely.<br>
    <br>
    The structure of the second conditional is [if + subject + past simple,] [subject + would + base form of the verb]. Look carefully at the comma after the if clause: it needs to be there when the if clause comes first. But, when you change the order of the clauses, you can remove the comma.<br>
    <br>
    And remember, even though we’re using past tenses, we’re imagining things in the present.<br>
    <br>
    The third conditional<br>
    <br>
    Next up, we have the third conditional. This is the conditional we use when we talk about hypothetical situations in the past. We often use this structure to imagine changing the past or things happening differently. Here are some examples of third conditional sentences:<br>
    <br>
    - I would have called you if I had known you were at home.<br>
    - If she had helped us, we would have finished earlier.If he had practised more, he would have passed his driving test.<br>
    - She wouldn’t have missed her flight if her alarm had gone off.<br>
    <br>
    The structure of the third conditional is [if + subject + past perfect,] [subject + would have + past participle]. Again, when the if clause comes first, we need a comma after it.<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - wish'
  answer:
    "
    We can use ‘would’ with the verb wish to talk about things we want people to do (or not do !) but we know they probably won’t. So, these are hypothetical sentences.<br>
    <br>
    We usually use the construction when we’re annoyed by someone’s habit or something they do regularly. It’s not usually about something no one can change and we don’t use it to talk about ourselves. The structure of this is [subject + wish] + [subject + would + base form of the verb].<br>
    <br>
    Here are a few examples:<br>
    <br>
    - I wish you wouldn’t leave the door unlocked.<br>
    - Sam wishes his dad wouldn’t smoke.<br>
    - I wish you would clean the house more often.<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - preferences'
  answer:
    "
    If we want to talk about what we or someone else prefers from several options, we can use the phrase would rather. This could be a real situation in the present or a hypothetical situation.<br>
    The structure is subject + would rather + base form of the verb.<br>
    <br>
    - I would rather get a takeaway today. I’m too tired to cook.<br>
    - Would you rather go to the cinema or the theatre?<br>
    - I would rather move to Canada than the US.<br>
    - We would rather start work at 8 am not 9.<br>
    - Would you rather have coffee or tea?<br>

  question: 'Provide an example: Would - give opinions'
  answer:
    "
    When we want to give our opinion about something but we want to be polite or we’re not sure we’re correct, we can use would as part of some set phrases.<br>
    <br>
    We often say I would think, I would imagine or I would guess.<br>
    <br>
    - I would think we need to talk to the manager before we commit to this.<br>
    - I would imagine it’s been a tough few days for him.<br>
    - I’d guess he would want to help.<br>
