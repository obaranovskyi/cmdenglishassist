  question: Explain how 'in case' differs from 'if'

      <li>I'll give you my phone number <b>in case</b> you need to contact me.</li>
      <li>You should insure your bike <b>in case</b> it is stolen.</li>
    </ul></i>

    <p><b>if</b></p>
    <i><ul>
      <li>We'll buy some more food <b>if</b> Tom comes. (= Maybe Tome will come. If he comes, we'll buy some more food. If he doesn't come, we won't buy any more food.)</li>
