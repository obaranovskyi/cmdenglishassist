  question: How to use <b>in spite of</b> or <b>despite</b>?
  answer:
    After <b>in spite of</b> or <b>despite</b>, we use a <i>noun</i>, a <i>pronoun</i>
    (<b>this/that/what etc.</b>) or -<b>ing</b>
    
    <i><ul>
      <li><b>I spite of the rain,</b> we had a good time.</li>
      <li>She wasn't well, but <b>in spite of this</b> she continued working.</li>
      <li><b>In spite of what</b> I said yesterday, I still love you.</li>
      <li>I didn't apply for the job <b>in spite of having</b> the necessary qualifications.</li>
    </ul></i>

    <p><b>Despite</b> is the same as <b>in spite of.</b> We say <b>in spite of,</b> but <b>despite</b>(without of):</p>
    <i><ul>
      <li>She wasn't well, but <b>despite this</b> she continued working.</li>
    </ul></i>

    <p>You can say 'in spite of the fact (that) ...' and 'despite the fact (that) ...'</p>
    <i><ul>
      <li>I didn't apply for the <b>job in spite of the fact</b> (that) I had the necessary qualifications.</li>
      <li>I didn't apply for the <b>job despite the fact</b> (that) I had the necessary qualifications.</li>
    </ul></i>

  question: Provide examples <b>though = although</b>
  answer:
    <i><ul>
      <li>I didn't apply for the job <b>though</b> I had the necessary qualifications.</li>
    </ul></i>

    <p>In spoken English we often use <b>though</b> at the ned of a sentence.</p>
    <i><ul>
      <li>The house isn't so nice. I like the garden <b>though.</b> (= but I like the garden)</li>
      <li>I see them every day. I've never spoken to them <b>though.</b> (= but I've never spoken to them)</li>
    </ul></i>

    <p><b>Even though</b> (<i>but not</i> 'even' alone) is similar to <b>although:</b></p>
    <i><ul>
      <li><b>Even though</b> I was really tired, I couldn't sleep. (<i>not</i> I was really tired)</li>
    </ul></i>
