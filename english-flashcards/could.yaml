  question: 'Provide an example: Could - Past - achievement'
  answer:
    "
    When actual past achievements are mentioned, we use was/were able to or managed to but not<br>
    could in affirmative clauses. This is because they are facts rather than possibilities:<br>
    <br>
    - I was able to/managed to buy a wonderful bag to match my shoes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Not: <s>I could buy a wonderful bag to match my shoes.<s><br>
    - We hired a car, and we were able to/managed to drive 1,000 miles in one week.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Not: <s>We hired a car, and we could drive 1,000 miles in one week.<s><br>
